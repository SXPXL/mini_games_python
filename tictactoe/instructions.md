## How to Play Tic Tac Toe

**Setup:**

1.  Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2.  Clone the `mini_games_python` repository if you haven't already.
3.  Navigate to the `tictactoe` directory within the repository.

**Running the Game:**

4.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
5.  Navigate to the `tictactoe` directory.
6.  Execute the game by running the command:
    ```bash
    python tictactoe.py
    ```
7.  The game board will be displayed with numbers representing the available spaces.
8.  You will be prompted to "Enter your move:" followed by a number corresponding to the space you want to mark with 'o'.
9.  The computer will then make its move, marked with 'x'.
10. The game continues until one player gets three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or until all spaces are filled (resulting in a draw).
11. The result of the game (You Won!, I Won!, or Draw!) will be displayed at the end.

## How to Contribute

We encourage you to contribute to the development of this Tic Tac Toe game and the `mini_games_python` repository! Here are some ways you can help:

* **Implement the Player vs. Player Mode:** Currently, the game is only against the computer. You could add an option at the beginning to choose between playing against the computer or another human player.
* **Add Difficulty Levels for the Computer:** The computer's moves are currently random. Implementing different difficulty levels (e.g., easy, medium, hard) would be a great enhancement.
* **Implement a "Play Again" Feature:** After a game ends, prompt the user if they want to play another round.
* **Improve Input Validation:** Make the game more robust by handling invalid user input (non-numeric input, numbers outside the valid range, or choosing an already occupied space) more gracefully.
* **Refactor the Code:** Look for ways to make the code cleaner, more efficient, and easier to understand.
* **Add Comments and Docstrings:** Improve the code's documentation to help others (and your future self) understand how it works.
* **Report Bugs:** If you find any issues or unexpected behavior, please open an issue in the main repository to let us know.

If you'd like to contribute code, please follow the general contribution guidelines outlined in the main `README.md` file of the repository. We welcome pull requests with your improvements!
